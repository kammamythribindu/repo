<p>HTML is the acronym for Hypertext Markup Language,which is the only markup language for creating web pages.
 It provides some titles, headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, embedded images, etc.
 to describe the structure of text-based information in HTML documents.
 It is easy to learn because every tag is predefined,
 so only we need to know the work of tags and its attributes.
we can write HTML in any simple editor like Notepad, notepad++, Sublime, etc.
HTML consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content.</p>
